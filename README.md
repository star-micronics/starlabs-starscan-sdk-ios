# StarSCAN SDK for iOS

This repository houses the StarSCAN Swift SDK for use with StarSCAN barcode readers.

The StarSCAN SDK is a device control framework for integrating StarSCAN scanners into iOS applications. This SDK uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology exclusively. All supported barcode readers must be in BLE mode to be use with this SDK. 

## Supported hardware

The following barcode readers are supported:

* BSH-20B
* BSH-32B

## Minimum Requirements

iOS 12.0 or higher  

**Note**: The iOS Simulator does not Bluetooth/BLE device connections.   
You must test on a physical device in order to connect to StarSCAN barcode readers.

## Features

Beyond providing a simple, seamless way of connecting to and reading scanned data from a barcode reader, the SDK provides the following additional features:

* In-app pairing using a device-specific barcode
* Read a variety of 1D & 2D barcodes
* Query battery levels
* Query firmware information
* Query the current device configuration
* Set the device configuration using a pre-built configuration file generated by our StarSCAN Utility for Windows
 
## Getting Started with the StarSCAN SDK

Add the StarSCAN.framework to your application.  

If you want to test drive the SDK prior to adding it to your project, run the included StarSCANDemo project.


**First time barcode reader setup**  
In order for the SDK to interface with the barcode reader, it must be in BLE mode. There simplest way to achieve this is to scan the configuration barcode below. This will change the scanners operating mode in preparation for use with our SDK.

## A brief note about Bluetooth HID mode
In the out of box configuration, StarSCAN barcode readers ship in Bluetooth HID mode; to emulate keyboard input.  
This mode can be used with any iDevice without SDK integration.   
Pair it as you would any normal Bluetooth keyboard and you can start capturing scanned data immediately.
